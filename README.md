## Background

Every month or so, Heyzap has a hackday where people can work on whatever Heyzap-related project they wish. Examples of past projects include Stumm, Immad and Chris Z making admin pages like https://www.heyzap.com/admin/timecube/ads or Jude making a jet-powered snowboard.

Hackdays are held on Fridays, and we typically vote on the best project the following Monday. Each person can vote 3 times, as long as it's not for their own project (just enforced on the honor system).

## Task

Make a website using Ruby on Rails for voting on Hackday projects. Your website should allow:

* Creating hackday events.
* Adding people's projects to that hackday event
* Allow people to vote on projects, up to 3 times. You can enforce the 3-votes-per-person rule using cookies.
* Functionality to close voting on a hackday and show the winner.

Our current site implementing this functionality is here: http://heyzaphackday.com/hackdays

While making this project:

* Create a git repo on github.com/heyzap. 
* Try to follow Ruby/Rails conventions as much as possible. The goal is to become familiar with Rails' conventions, not to make the site as quick as possible.

After you finish the site, we'll review your code to make sure you're familiar with Rails concepts before you start working on production code.
